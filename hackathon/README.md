## Document certification - Proof of existence
Due to the Blockchain technology there are more and more virtual notary services available: https://proofofexistence.com/, https://stampery.com/, https://poex.io/, https://chainy.info/… With these services you are able to write data (e.g. a hash of a document) to the blockchain. The private key that was used to generate the transaction message allows you to proof the ownership, the existence but also the integrity of any kind of data without relying on trusted third parties. The service is also often used to proof that a specific recipient read your email at a certain point in time. A physical token, representing ownership of the data, maybe embedded in a real contract etc., does make sense.

Within this example the service proofofexistence for bitcoin was used to generate a transaction with the DOCPROOF attribute of the bitcoin network: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/51bf2164bdf67e2a4fcf216dc2ec9f11778d177c58c2be9db6a8f017c996e95a

## Physical Cryptokitties
With this project a physical form of the Ethereum based Cryptokitties was generated. Therefore key1 of the card was read out and converted to an Ethereum address. After that, 6 Kitties were bought at the market and transferred to the prepared and printed card. All transfers can be checked at etherscan.io.
